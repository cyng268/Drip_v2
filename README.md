- 🎥 **Video recording** 
- 🔍 **Zoom controls** 
- 📡 **ICR controls** 

## System Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 5 (64-bit OS)
- USB camera
- X11 display server

## Installation

### 1. Required Dependencies

Install OpenCV for C++:
```bash
sudo apt install libopencv-dev
```

Install xdotool for window control:
```bash
sudo apt-get install xdotool
```

Install CodeBlocks IDE:
```bash
sudo apt install codeblocks
```

### 2. Setup X11 Display Server
